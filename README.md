## What I Discovered about history:
> The universe is created with a moral order. The moral order binds and
> insists humans find truth, help, and raise voices for those
> communities and people who are oppressed and never get a chance to
> explore the creativity of this universe.

> Governance should be based on truth. Truth has been coming throughout
> history. Truth has come to many people before it came to us. **Be
> careful!** Truth even came to Brazilian Indians and the Indigenous
> Australians, who had a great respect for a river.
> 
> Truth is absolute and it is that truth the universal truth, that
> eternal truth that is coming to mankind for so long before it came to
> us. In the end that will triumph.
