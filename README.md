## What I Discovered about history:
> The universe is created with a moral order. The moral order binds and
> insists humans find truth, help, and raise voices for those
> communities and people who are oppressed and never get a chance to
> explore the creativity of this universe.

> Truth has come to many people before it came to us, and it is that
> truth the universal truth, that eternal truth that is coming to
> mankind for so long before it came to us. In the end that will triumph.
